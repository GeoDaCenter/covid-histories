Story Submission Overview
-------------------------

Here's an overview of the Atlas Stories submission process.

1.  To get started, **head to the submission page** at
    [stories.uscovidatlas.org/submit](https://stories.uscovidatlas.org/submit).

2.  Next, **choose your story type**. You may choose to submit a video
    or audio diary, written story, photograph or image, or call in a
    phone-based story to our Atlas Stories Hotline. Note that you can
    submit up to 3 separate stories of any combination of media.

3.  **Choose one of the five themes** to get started. For each
    theme, we've provided a few prompts for you to think about.

4.  **Sign up or login to your account.** We ask you to create an
    account with a valid email address so that you can easily access
    your story later. Signing up is easy - you can continue with your
    Gmail account if you have one, or create an account with your
    email address and set a password.

5.  Here's the fun part -- **create your story!** Follow the instructions for the story
    type you selected (video or audio, written, photograph or image, or phone-based story).

6.  **Submit your story** when you're done recording or writing. Select your county and state. Give your story an
    optional title. Review and consent to the [License and Terms of
    Use](https://stories.uscovidatlas.org/license). Indicate whether you'd like to participate in future research
    about your pandemic experience. Hit "Submit". Contrats, your story is submitted!

7.  **Finally, tell us a bit more about yourself**. We'll ask five
    optional questions about your racial identity, gender identity,
    age, and whether you live in a rural, suburban, or urban area. All
    questions are optional and you can choose to respond to some or
    all. Your responses will only be used for internal evaluation
    purposes and never shared publicly.

8.  **That's it!** You've successfully submitted your story. Check back
    in the coming days to view your story on the US Covid Atlas.
