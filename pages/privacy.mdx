# Privacy

Thank you for your interest in the US Covid Atlas Oral Histories
program. We want to share more information about the privacy license and
the terms you are agreeing to by sharing your story with us.

**Your privacy is extremely important to us.**

We believe that your
story and your data are *yours;* ultimately you retain control over how
and where your story is used.

## Frequently Asked questions

**When will you access my microphone or camera?**

> Your microphone and camera will be accessed to record your submission if you are making a audio/video story submission on the [submit](/submit) page. You will be prompted to allow our site to access your microphone and camera, and we will not access your microphone or camera without your permission.

> After granting permission, you can click the green record button, at which point the website will use your microphone and/or camera to record your story.

**When are my files sent to your server?**

> Your story will only be stored on your computer until you hit the submit button. You can go back and re-record your story until you are happy with it. 

**Where will my data be stored?**

> Your data will be stored on a secure server in the United States. Your data will be viewable to you and the project admins, but no one else until it is reviewed and integrated with the Atlas website. Once public, your data will be stored on a separate content server that is public.

**How long will my data be stored? Can I delete my data?**

> We have worked to ensure this archive can live on past the immediate project duration of the COVID Atlas. Similarly, you can delete your data at any time.
