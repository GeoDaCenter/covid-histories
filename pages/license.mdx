### US Covid Atlas Oral Histories Program

#### License & Terms of Use

Thank you for participating in the US Covid Atlas Oral Histories program (the
"Program"). The Program's goal is to compile a record of our collective
experiences during, and as a result of, the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
intent is to make donated material widely accessible to researchers and
the public for the purpose of conducting research and archiving our
individual and shared experiences of this extraordinary time. This
license sets forth the terms that will govern our use of any materials
you choose to contribute to the Program.

#### **Donating My Story**

In donating my photos, audio, video, written, or other materials (the
"Licensed Material") to the Program, I agree to the following terms:

I certify that I am at least 18 years of age (if under the age of
18, this consent form must be signed by a parent or legal guardian, if
under the age of 13, you are not able to participate at this time),
and I voluntarily agree to share my interviews, images, and personal
documents with the US Covid Atlas Project ("the Atlas") and the
University of Chicago ("the University").

I am the original author or creator of the entirety of the Licensed
Material. To the best of my knowledge, the materials I am submitting
do not infringe or violate any rights of others.

I understand that I shall receive no compensation for the materials
I share. I will receive a link to download a copy of my materials
after submitting.

#### **Basic Permissions**

I retain the original copyright of my Licensed Material, and I may use
them for any purposes. I agree to freely share my interview (and other
items listed above), under a non-exclusive, perpetual license that
permits the Licensed Material to be distributed in part or in whole
through the US Covid Atlas website and related media, including but not
limited to print, presentation, and the internet. Specifically, I permit
the Atlas and the University to:

1.  Make a digital reproduction of my Licensed Material and to retain
    the digital reproduction.

2.  Display digital reproductions of my Licensed Material via the
    Internet or successive technologies.

3.  Create derivative works from my Licensed Material such as edits or
    compilations.

4.  Distribute copies of my Licensed Material or derivatives to users
    and partners of the Atlas and the University.

5.  To grant third parties any of the foregoing rights.

#### **Identity and Authorship**

In the publication of my Licensed Material in the Atlas, the following
information will be made publicly available:

* The photos, audio, video, written, or other materials I provide, in
part or in whole.
* The center point or spatial boundary of the US county I provide as
the location for this story, but no more detailed location
information.
* My name will not be associated with my oral history unless I choose
to include it. I can choose the form option "Attribute my Video" and
my name will then be associated with the published materials.
* There is additional information collected in my submission that **will
not** be made publicly available:
* My reported race, ethnicity, gender, and other demographic survey
information.
* My email or contact information, affiliations, and other digitally
collected information

#### **Removing my Materials**

I have the right to request my Licensed Materials be removed at any
time. The Project development is scheduled to stop in May 2023, so my
request to remove materials will be accommodated through that date.
After May 31st, 2023, we may be unable to accommodate your request to
remove your Licensed Materials. To request removal of my Licensed
Materials, you should:

enter the password you received via email, and select the option to
request removal of your materials.
* Alternatively, email theuscovidatlas@gmail.com and request your
materials be removed.

#### **Liability and Compensation**

I waive any right to inspect or claim any form of remuneration for the
use of the Licensed Material in any Atlas or University publication; any
other form of media published by the Atlas, the University, or another
institution authorized to use my Licensed Material; or any newspaper or
other commercial media outlet.
