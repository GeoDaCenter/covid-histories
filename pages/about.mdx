# About

The [US Covid Atlas](http://uscovidatlas.org) works to
understand, archive, and represent the often unequal impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The Atlas is a free, interactive
data visualization tool connecting COVID-19 data with community health
contexts to deliver insights about the pandemic across the country.
After more than two years of mapping and visualizing the numbers behind
the pandemic, we're now turning to the stories behind the statistics.

**The Atlas Oral Histories project aims to elevate the human perspective
alongside the data of the pandemic.** The pandemic has impacted
everyone's life. And everyone has a story to tell about their
experience. By participating in this pandemic Oral Histories project,
whether you decide to record a video or audio, write about your
experience, upload a picture, or call-in your story, you will ultimately
be lifting up the stories behind the data. Your story helps humanize the
statistics within the pandemic experience.

**How will your story be visualized on the Atlas?** The only information
that we require for you to share along with your story submission is
your US county of residence (or county most relevant to your pandemic
experience). This allows us to geo-tag your story in a random location
in that county, to match with the other county-level data currently
featured on the US Covid Atlas.

To learn more, read our **Story Submission Overview** and
review our **[Privacy License & Terms of
Use](https://stories.uscovidatlas.org/privacy)**. If you're
ready to share your story, go ahead and **[Submit your
Story](https://stories.uscovidatlas.org/submit)** now!

Story Submission Overview

    [stories.uscovidatlas.org/submit](https://stories.uscovidatlas.org/submit).

2.  Next, **choose your story type**. You may choose to submit a video
    or audio diary, written story, photograph or image, or call in a
    phone-based story to our Atlas Stories Hotline. Note that you can
    submit up to 3 separate stories of any combination of media.

3.  Then, **choose one of the five themes** to get started. For each
    theme, we've provided a few prompts for you to think about.

4.  Next, **sign up or login to your account.** We ask you to create an
    account with a valid email address so that you can easily access
    your story later. Signing up is easy - you can continue with your
    Gmail account if you have one, or create an account with your
    email address and set a password.

5.  Then, **create your story.** Follow the instructions for the story
    type you selected (video or audio diary, written story, photograph
    or image, or phone-based story).

6.  Next, **submit your story**. Select the US count and state that
    you're in or most relevant to your story. Give your story an
    optional story. Review and consent to the License and Terms of
    Use. Indicate whether you'd like to participate in future research
    about your pandemic experience. Contrats, your story is submitted!

7.  Finally, **tell us a bit more about yourself**. We'll ask five
    optional questions about your racial identity, gender identity,
    age, and whether you live in a rural, suburban, or urban area. All
    questions are optional and you can choose to respond to some or
    all. Your responses will only be used for internal evaluation
    purposes and never shared publicly.
