# About

The [US Covid Atlas](http://uscovidatlas.org) works to understand, archive, and
represent the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The Atlas is
a free, interactive data visualization tool connecting COVID-19 data with
community health indicators to deliver insights about the pandemic across the
country. After more than two years of mapping and visualizing the numbers behind
the pandemic, we're now turning to the stories behind the statistics.

**Atlas Stories aims to elevate the human perspective alongside the data of the
pandemic.** Everyone has a story to tell about their pandemic experiences. By participating in this pandemic oral histories
project -- whether through recording a video or audio story, writing about your
experience, uploading a picture, or calling in your story -- you are lifting up
the stories behind the statistics and humanizing the data.

**How will your story be visualized on the Atlas?** The only information that we
require for you to share along with your story submission is your county of
residence (or county most relevant to your pandemic experience) in the United
States. This allows us to geo-tag your story in a random location in that
county, to match with other county-level data currently featured on the Atlas.

To learn more, read our **[Story Submission Overview](/submission-overview)**
and review our **[Privacy License & Terms of Use](/privacy)**. If you're ready
to share your story, go ahead and **[Submit your Story](/submit)** now!
