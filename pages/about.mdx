# About

The [US Covid Atlas](http://uscovidatlas.org) works to
understand, archive, and represent the often unequal impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The Atlas is a free, interactive
data visualization tool connecting COVID-19 data with community health
contexts to deliver insights about the pandemic across the country.
After more than two years of mapping and visualizing the numbers behind
the pandemic, we're now turning to the stories behind the statistics.

**The Atlas Oral Histories project aims to elevate the human perspective
alongside the data of the pandemic.** The pandemic has impacted
everyone's life. And everyone has a story to tell about their
experience. By participating in this pandemic Oral Histories project,
whether you decide to record a video or audio, write about your
experience, upload a picture, or call-in your story, you will ultimately
be lifting up the stories behind the data. Your story helps humanize the
statistics within the pandemic experience.

**How will your story be visualized on the Atlas?** The only information
that we require for you to share along with your story submission is
your US county of residence (or county most relevant to your pandemic
experience). This allows us to geo-tag your story in a random location
in that county, to match with the other county-level data currently
featured on the US Covid Atlas.

To learn more, read our **[Story Submission Overview](/submission-overview)** and
review our **[Privacy License & Terms of
Use](/privacy)**. If you're
ready to share your story, go ahead and **[Submit your
Story](/submit)** now!
